# LFP_Analysis_With_Pynapple
This notebook uses pynapple toolbox to filter theta frequencies from LFP recordings.  Experiment details: delivering optogenetic stimulation (different frequencies and type) to the brain and measuring arousal related behavior (pupil diameter, locomotion on treadmill, facial motion, and hippocampal local field potentials) in head fixed mice. (N=1)
